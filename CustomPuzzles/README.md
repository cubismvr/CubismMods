# Cubism Custom Puzzles

As of version 1.1.0, you can now sideload custom puzzles into [Cubism](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2264524423619421/?locale=en_US). 

Puzzles are described by a `.cube` file (JSON with a fancy file type). These can be placed in a specific folder on your Quest/Computer, after which they will show up in a new 'Custom Puzzles' menu item in the game.

This repo contains some examples of `.cube` files, descriptions of how the `.cube` file is organized and instructions on how to sideload them.
