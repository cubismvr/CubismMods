# Cubism Custom Puzzles

As of version 1.1.0, you can now sideload custom puzzles onto [Cubism](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2264524423619421/?locale=en_US). 

Puzzles are described by a `.cube` file (JSON with a fancy file type). These can be placed in a specific folder on your Quest/Computer, after which they will show up in a new 'Custom Puzzles' menu item in the game.

This repo contains some examples of `.cube` files, descriptions of how the `.cube` file is organized and instructions on how to sideload them.

4. Navigate to the `sdcard/Android/data/com.tvb.cubism/files/CustomPuzzles`. If you don't see a `CustomPuzzles` folder, make sure you've updated Cubism to version 1.1.0 or later, and have opened the game at least once since updating.
5. Press the plus button in the bottom right to add files to this folder. Select the `.cube` files from your filesystem and upload them here.
