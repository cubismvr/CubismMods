# Custom Themes

As of version 1.1.0, you can modify Cubism's color theme by dropping a Cubism Theme File (`.ctf`) in a specific folder on your Quest/Computer. This will let you modify the appearance aspects of the game's environment, puzzle grid and menu.

## Custom theme example
This repo contains [a theme file example](https://github.com/cubismvr/Mods/blob/main/CustomColorTheme/ExampleLight.ctf) with comments to explain how the `.ctf` format works. You can use this file as a template to make your own themes.
